# Install Instructions

Backup Anything You Can't Stand to Lose
This Will Wipe All Data

1) adb reboot recovery

2) wipe data / factory reset

3) reboot to bootloader

4) fastboot devices - verify device is connected and seen

5) ./install.sh [Linux]
or
5) install.cmd [Windows]

NOTES

* fastboot will most likely hang at first command

** unplug device and you will see "unable to detect slot" error

*** replug in device and let it go

**** if when replugging device fastboot does not continue on its own, 
run 
./install.sh or install.cmd again and it will succeed


Turn on your Mobile Data and Reboot after First Boot and everything should be working like normal--I opted out of using a SetupWizard as it really isn't necessary, and wastes time as you can use the phone immediately after install without having to go through a bunch of setup bs
